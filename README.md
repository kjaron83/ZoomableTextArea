This project contains a **ZoomableTextArea** component. The class extends [JTextArea](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/JTextArea.html) to support font size changing by **CTRL + mouse wheel** moving.

This component was needed in a previous project. I have made it independent for reusing the code somewhere else.
